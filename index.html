				</div>
				<div class="section-details">
					<h3>The Barnes Witz is a hypothetical offshoot of the Philadelphia Barnes Foundation’s art museum educational programming — encompassing an experiential interactive webspace based around showcasing the collection's carefully curated ensembles as 3D rotating carousels.</h3>
					<h3>The space is designed to draw teenagers to explore and be inspired by both the Barnes Collection, and to speak to the potential that lies in staying true to your creative whims. The project also seeks to underscore the importance of both increased and increasingly accessible teen programming at art museums across the country.</h3>

					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-details">
					<p>The issue that I set out to address and explore in this project was the question of how a museum can reach a next generation of screen-oriented supporters and patrons. This effort is to
ensure that The Museum as an institution continues to be seen as relevant and worthwhile, even while competing with the museum of the Internet.</p>
					<p>Using the Barnes Foundation as a case study, I wanted to create a prototype of a design strategy for museums to create digital presences that are a draw to teenagers. The Barnes Foundation is built on its founder’s ensemble goupings of its eclectic collection. I intended to carry these carefully thought-out collections into a website that allows its user to scroll through the digital arrangement of each ensemble and room.</p>

					<h2>Questions, Thoughts toward a Solution</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-details">
					<p>It was also important to me to bring an element of personal engagement with the collection into play. I had several ideas in mind, but as the project progressed, and I gathered information from various knowledgable sources, a solution was solidified.</p>
					<p>One of the first ideas that came to mind was a quiz-type game, where a student could input their age and information about what various artists represented in the collection were doing when they were the same age. Due to time, information, and programming-capability constraints, this idea quickly was set aside as a potential "Next Steps," further-down-the-line idea.</p>
					<p>Another idea that was an early iteration was incorporating some kind of social media recreating-artworks challenge. This was ultimately less interesting to me as it has already been done, and, while it could definitely easily garner attention and engagement with a museum's collection, I kept coming back to the idea of wanting a teenager to really feel that it was possible that one day, perhaps their work could be hanging in a museum. And even if a teen has zero interest in this kind of aspiration, that metaphorically, it would be inspiring on many levels to imagine that, "what if? Because I can really do anything" sentiment.</p>

					<h2>Relative Research, Data Collection, Applied Results of User / Audience / SME Feedback</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-details">
					<p>I am surprised at the fruitful experiences I had in meeting with and collecting data from various relevant and fascinating sources.</p>
					<h3>My 15-Year Old Brother</h3>
					<p>Meeting first with my brother Henry (over the phone) led me to realize that teenagers of this era really do have different minds than my Millenial generation. When I asked him what he thought of when he thought of a digital museum exhibit, he immediately referenced AR, and school-related experiences he had had with that technology. I was happy that my site endeavored to address 3D space, even in some capacity. It was also helpful to hear his general sentiment upon seeing my site prototype for the first time: "This is great, just don't make it like, 'you should learn this,' but more like, 'you can learn what you want to if you think it's cool.'"</p>
					<h3>Jen Nadler, Director of preK-12 and Educator Programs at the Barnes Foundation</h3>
					<p>Jen really has to be credited with helping me to solidify several important ideas. First of all, early on in our meeting, Jen pointed out that, while the Barnes has little teen-specific programming, an overarching theme of museum education practice for teens is focusing on their innate need for CHOICE, and to have their voices and points-of-view taken seriously and put out there. She asked me nonchalantly if there were a way for users to include or pair their own work alongside the artworks of their choice throughout the collection. As a result I endeavored to create the option for users to add their own artworks, or images of their choice (using URLs at least) to the existing carousels. While I have not finalized the functionality of this feature, I hope to be able to do so by the end of the semester.</p>
					<h3>70+ High School Students</h3>
					<p>In brainstorming how I could get a broader array of responses from teens, as opposed to just speaking with my brother, I remembered having bumped into my freshman year high school art teacher last spring. Realizing that she was still teaching high school art classes, even during the pandemic, I reached out to her and provided her with a survey that anonymously gathered data from teenagers in her 5-or-so art classes. She warned me that she was teaching 3 sections of "Computer Art" this semester, noting that the students in those classes "aren't your typical art student." Even better! As a result of these responses, I have such exciting insights into what teens these days enjoy the most about their digital experiences, and the elements of design that they are most quick to judge in visiting a website (they are color and photos!)</p>
					<h3>Olivia Verdugo, Art Director at the Barnes Foundation</h3>
					<p>Olivia advised me in my identity design and the design of the website. It was because of her feedback that I followed a path that I hadn't been sure of in terms of the logo, and I am happy with how the logo works on its own, and in a "lock-up" with the existing Barnes identity designed by Pentagram to speak to the Barnes ensembles.</p>

					<h2>Process + Tools</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-details">
					<p>For this project I worked primarily with coding and Adobe design software, both tracks that speak to what the MAGWD has focused us on. I truly enjoy working in both areas, and using both at the same time is a fun way to get relief from both interchangably. Each one refreshes the other.</p>
					<p>My process centered around trying coding solutions out with GitHub, and using GitHub's capabilities to "branch" off in various directions with the confidence that you can merge or loop back around if one unknown exploration doesn't work out. My design process for the identity, similarly involved many layers of exploration and journeys, all of which were recorded as part of what makes the project a rich endeavor.</p>
					<h3>Tools used included:</h3>

						<li>HTML, CSS</li>

					<h2>Arriving at a Solution</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="section-details">
					<p>The solutions I arrived at were a product of combining my original intent, feedback outlined above, and the constraints of time. I endeavor to continue perfecting the functionality of the interactive elements related to the carousels and finalize inputting the artworks information into their title cards. I also hope to incorporate merchandise mock-ups and additional social media-friendly animations and templates for use in advertising and social media sharing.</p>
